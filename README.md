# VAE ToolBox

Intent to configure a modulatory method to build and train variational autoencoders based on custom architectures and losses. 

Continuation of work from Antoine Marot on  "Interpreting atypical conditions in systems with deep conditional Autoencoders: the case of electrical consumption" submitted at ECML-PKDD 2019
https://github.com/marota/Autoencoder_Embedding_Expert_Caracteristion_

Main features:
* Choices of architectures for encoder or decoder blocks
* Various losses combination available
* Metrics of disentanglement
* Callback on the analysis of leanrt information in hidden layers of the model
